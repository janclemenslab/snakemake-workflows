- Rules can use wrappers in `#Common/snakemake-workflows/RULENAME` (see [here](https://snakemake-wrappers.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#contribute)):
    - `wrapper.py`
    - `environment.yaml` - conda environment for each rule (will be created automatically by snakemake and used for executing the rule. Snakemake will update the environment when the rule file changes)
    - `meta.yaml` (optional)
    - `models` or other folders for tf models etc.
